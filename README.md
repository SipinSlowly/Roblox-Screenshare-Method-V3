new ss method i leaked, made by a;#0002

steps:

2. Tell your victim to login with Quick Log In.


3. Tell them to refresh twice (this will make sure your victim forgets the code they've originally had.)


4. They will login (use vpn to go to which area they are from, you can use a oneclick ip logger or get their location someother way.)


5. Say it is possible things like this can be tampered with, can you use your old code?


6. They wont remember it because step 3 confuses them, so give them **YOUR** login code, they will confirm it, and it will display their location, so they will belive it is actually their code their logging in with, you are now logged in.
